                            <p>
                                Bright and colorful, sweet with just a hint of booze, the Dirty Shirley quickly became THE drink of summer 2022, thanks in part to its popularity on TikTok. It's a boozy version of the classic Shirley Temple so many of us grew up with—and let's be honest, what too-sweet mocktail can't be improved with a shot of vodka ?

                    <h4>Q: What's the difference between coffee and espresso?</h4>
                    <p>A: Coffee is typically brewed by passing hot water through ground coffee beans, while espresso is made by forcing a small amount of nearly boiling water through finely-ground coffee beans. Espresso is more concentrated and has a layer of crema on top.</p>
